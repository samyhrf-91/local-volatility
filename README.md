 The goal of this project is to estimate the local volatility surface from call option data. 
 Firstly, the project propose to derive the Dupire's formula, and then to plot the surfaces of the call option data. 
 Local volatility is approximated using finite differences. We noticed that this method is numerically unstable. 
 Thus, we tried to implement the newton optimisation algorithm.

 To start this project, one needs to download the two csv files containing the call option data
